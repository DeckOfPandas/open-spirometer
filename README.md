Open-spirometer
====
A spirometer is a device that measures your breathing. This is particularly helpful medically forthe managment of chronic lung diseases such as asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, and COPD.

Open-spirometer is special because it's design will be open and because it will capture and share, with user consent, high quality open spirometry data from day one. 

We'd love you to get involved by using what we make, reporting bugs/suggesting improvements, and fixing bugs/making improvements.  Please refer to the CONTRIBUTING file.

Open-spirometer is an open (open governance/design/hardware/source) commercial health product by Open Health Care UK that we've not made yet.


What problem does Open-spirometer solve?
======
Open-spirometer aims to solve the paucity of high quality independant open spirometry data problem. We think patients and health care professionals would be empowered to make better decisions together if they had better data. At present spirometery data often lies locked up in proprietary spirometry devices and non-digital data formats.


Open governance
======

Roadmap: 

Discussion List: 

Access: availability of the latest source code, developer
support mechanisms, public roadmap, and transparency of
decision-making

Development: the ability of developers to influence the content
and direction of the project

Derivatives: the ability for developers to create and distribute
derivatives of the source code in the form of spin-off projects,
handsets or applications.

Community: a community structure that does not discriminate
between developers
